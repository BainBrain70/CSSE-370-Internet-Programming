Test cases 
Project Phase #1
1) 2 HTML pages
2) The HTML pages are linked together
3) Header tags exist
4) each page displays 
5) each page has at least 3 external links

Project Phase #2
1) Css was aplied to my javascript page
2) Css has its own document that is loaded into the html

Project Phase #3
1) Cannot load a screen shot to Moodle but google tool does not bring up any errors

Project Phase #4
1)The "Click Me" Button will display an image that is styled by the Css page with a 5px black boarder 
2) The picture does not dissapear when you click it, I was unable to include that functionality.
3)The 3 links in the bottom center of the screen will trun green if you mouse over them

Project Phase #5
1)Then Andi tool does not return any erros, a screen shot is located in repositroy in the file titled ANDI

Project Phase #6
1)Below the Click me button the current weather is displayed on a button that, when clicked, will disply the
daily low temperature for the day. I had tried to interface with a stock related API called AlphaVantage but was unsucessul in 
retrieving the data, so I went with a generic weather API that I had used before and knew that it worked. 

Project Phase #7
1)The Zap tool only reported server side errors, the screen shot is uploaded into moodle

Project Phase #8
1)The button Labeled React is just below the API button on my sidebar and will load react object to the screen. 

Additional Notes: I addressed the comments that you left on the first few Project Phases and corrected the errors that you indicated. 
I am hoping that I can get some of the points back that I lost on the first few project Phases. Over all I did my best to torubleshoot 
the errors and complete the Project Phase objectives as close to the specifications as possible.
